## Application Overview

Stronghold HD delivers the quintessential medieval castle simulation experience that influenced countless strategy games following its original 2001 release. Firefly Studios' masterpiece combined economic city-building with real-time tactical combat, creating a hybrid genre experience that remains compelling decades later.

The free build mode removes combat entirely, allowing players to focus on sandbox-style castle construction and economic optimization. This mode highlights the depth of Stronghold’s simulation systems without military pressure.

The scenario editor empowers creative players to design custom missions with terrain modification, scripted events, and custom victory conditions. Community-created scenarios extend replayability far beyond the original campaigns.

Historical campaigns recreate famous medieval sieges with carefully designed missions, while economic campaigns focus on production chains and population management rather than warfare.

Unit variety spans the full medieval spectrum, from peasant levies to elite knights, each with distinct tactical roles. Defensive architecture and battlefield tactics evolved into a strategic art form through years of community experimentation.
